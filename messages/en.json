      "questions": {
        "q1": {
          "question": "Where does your honey come from?",
          "answer": "Our honey comes directly from hives located in the Kabylie mountains, Algeria. We work with local beekeepers who share our values of quality and tradition."
        },
        "q2": {
          "question": "Is your honey really organic?",
          "answer": "Yes, all our honeys are certified organic. No pesticides or chemical additives are used in our hives. We guarantee a 100% natural and pure product."
        },
        "q3": {
          "question": "What's the difference between jujube and eucalyptus honey?",
          "answer": "Jujube (sidr) honey is sweeter with fruity notes, while eucalyptus has a stronger taste and soothing properties for the throat. Each honey has its own benefits."
        },
        "q4": {
          "question": "How should I store honey?",
          "answer": "Store your honey in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight. Honey never expires but may crystallize over time, which is a sign of natural quality."
        },
        "q5": {
          "question": "Is crystallized honey still good?",
          "answer": "Yes, crystallization is a natural phenomenon for pure honey. To liquefy it, place the jar in warm (not hot) water until it returns to its liquid consistency."
        },
        "q6": {
          "question": "What are the delivery times?",
